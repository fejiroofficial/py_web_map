# py_web_map
What is a web map? “Web map” often implies a map that is not simply on the web, but rather one that is powered by the web. A digital map is on a computer, but may not be accessible by internet, and is relatively static if it is. A web map depends on the internet. It is usually interactive and not always self-contained.
